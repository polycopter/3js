3js
===

just a simple script I downloaded from 
[http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene] 
...and then modified a little bit. A nonet of spinning icosahedra.

dependency: Three.js (see http://threejs.org)

to use:

1. create a folder named js; 
... place three.min.js (Three.js minified) & my3.js there
2. create a sibling folder; 
... place test3js.html there
3. open test3js.html (in a browser that Three.js supports)
